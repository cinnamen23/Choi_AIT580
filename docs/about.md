  My name is Tuan Nguyen. I came from Vietnam. This is my 2nd semester at Mason and my major is Data Analytic Engineering. My previous major was Water Resources Engineering, and I had some experience working with weather data during my previous job.

  My goal is to learn more about machine learning/deep learning and their application to apply them in the field of hydrology. I'm interested in studying the application of Neural Network in weather data forecasting.

  I have experience with Excel models, VBA, C and I'm familiar with the basics in Python, SQL, and R.

  It is a pleasure to meet you and I am looking forward to study this course.

  Hello, my name is seunggyu Choi from South Korea. Also, you guys can call me Simon. I am pursuing an MS data analytics degree; after acquiring my master's degree, I am planning to get a job in the data analytics field. My goal is to study practical skills that I can use in the hands-on field, handle large amounts of data, and discover insights through various tools.

  My major was industrial management, and it covered statistics, programming, industrial supply chain, etc., overall knowledge on the industrial field. And then, I had gotten training by concentrating on web programming education, and I did a project Advertising web site base on the MS cognitive program as my capstone project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27WtJDR0-KM&t=86s (I am sorry, It was demonstrated by my home language )

  And then, I had an Internship in the US as an IT intern for one year; during that period, I cleaned data and set rules for getting coherent data from the field and visualization through Excel and VBA. I have experience about Java, Java script, SPSS, Node JS, Oracle, Mysql

  I am really glad to meet you guys all as a classmate. Thanks for spending your time to read my introduction!
